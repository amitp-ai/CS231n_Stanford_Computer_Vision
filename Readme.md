# Completed CS231n Assignments

NOTE: ALL THE CODE IN CS231N ASSIGNMENTS IS INITIALLY DONE FOR PYTHON 2. BUT I HAVE MODIFIED IT TO RUN ON PYTHON 3. BUT A FEW PLACES MAY STILL HAVE PROBLEMS RUNNING.

Also: need to update g++ compiler by running the following (need this to run cython command properly for assignment 2):
sudo apt-get install g++
